Title: Automatic configuration of Windows instances in OpenStack, part 1
Slug: openstack-windows-1

This is the first of two articles in which I will discuss my work in
getting some Windows instances up and running in our [OpenStack][]
environment.  This article is primarily about problems I encountered
along the way, while the [second article][] will focus on the mechanism I
eventually put in place.
