I was poking around in a command shell on my Droid to see what was available. While it's a pretty restricted environment, there's a number of commands available in /system/bin, including dexopt.

Apparently dexopt isn't something I'm supposed to poke at:
    
    
    $ dexopt
    Usage: don't use this
    

Hah.
